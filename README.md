# Interactive Poetry

Exploring the intersection of code, creativity, and expression. See the [deployed github pages site](https://low-ghost.github.io/interactive-poetry) to peruse examples.

## Automatic Deployment

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys the site to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

## Slides

Slides for a presentation on some of the examples and theoretical implications of poetry and computing entitled 'The Function as a Breath of Thought: On the Computer as a Compositional and Performance Tool for Poetry' are available [here](https://low-ghost.github.io/interactive-poetry/slides/slides.html).

The html is also generated and deployed on `main` branch updates, starting as [marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/) markdown at [slides.md](https://github.com/low-ghost/interactive-poetry/blob/main/slides.md).
