export const POEM = `When a storm comes all at once the arguers hold
their breath. Whether or not they understand one
another, the edges of a formerly nice day cannot
station like a set of sunny parentheses around any
one idea. So who’ll risk uttering some phrase the other
might hate? Sudden human connection—
much like a May thundersnow’s shifted course
or the rush hour traffic report—cannot
be predicted by experts to everyone’s liking.
No one’s telling the tornado’s fortune.
No one’s advising the lightning where to strike.
This is how I understand an argument
to work: two or more people falling,
more like off-course parachutists
than any weather phenomena, forced
to land on the roof of language, droproll,
then wonder what’s holding them up top.
Then wonder why a fractal would fall and glitter
a cold cheek just when they both were about to say how
beautiful. I mean how stupid. I mean language has no roof.`;
